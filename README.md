## Published version

A published version will soon be available on [Leanpub](https://leanpub.com). 

## Markdown flavor

Leanpub uses a specific flavor of Markdown. As much as possible, this book is written using GitHub-Flavored Markdown to improve rendering on GitHub and elsewhere, while staying compatible with Leanpub. 

The only exceptions are info, tip, warning and error text boxes defined with `I>`, `T>`, `W>` and `E>` instead of the classic `>` syntax. Read the [Leanpub documentation](https://leanpub.com/help/manual#leanpub-auto-more-text-block-types) for more details.

## Acknowledgments

This book is built upon two online courses I wrote for the French EdTech startup [OpenClassrooms](https://openclassrooms.com):

* [Learn to code with JavaScript](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/learn-the-basics-of-javascript) ([Apprenez à coder avec JavaScript](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/apprenez-a-coder-avec-javascript)) 
* [Use JavaScript in your web projects](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/use-javascript-on-the-web) ([Créez des pages web interactives avec JavaScript](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/creez-des-pages-web-interactives-avec-javascript))

Thanks to [Jessica Mautref](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jessicamautref) for her watchful eye during the writing process, and to [Emily Reese](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eclairereese) for the initial English translation. Both also contributed many good ideas.

I've been inspired by other authors who decided to publish their books in an open way: [Kyle Simpson](https://github.com/getify), [Nicholas C. Zakas](https://www.nczonline.net/), [Axel Rauschmayer](http://dr-axel.de/) and [Marijn Haverbeke](http://marijnhaverbeke.nl/).
