## Overview

"The JavaScript Way" is a book to help you get off to a good start in the JavaScript universe or catch up with its newest evolutions. Here are some highlights:

* Designed to be as beginner-friendly as possible, while covering some advanced concepts and following good practices.
* No complex setup needed: start working immediately from your browser.
* Written from scratch using the latest language standard (ES6/ES2015), avoiding awkwardnesses from the past and giving you future-proof knowledge.
* Each chapter is accompanied by a series of exercises to put your newly acquired skills into practice.
