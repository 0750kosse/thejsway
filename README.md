## Overview

"The JavaScript Way" is a book to help you get off to a good start in the JavaScript universe or catch up with its latest evolutions. It was carefully designed to be:

* **Beginner-friendly, yet comprehensive**. You'll learn the essentials parts of the language all the way to the basics of full-stack web development. No previous knowledge needed!
* **Standards-aligned**. From start to finish, the book enforces good programming habits, embraces ubiquitous JavaScript tools [ESLint](http://eslint.org) and [Prettier](https://github.com/prettier/prettier) and closely follows the popular [AirBnb Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript).
* **Future-proof**. It is entirely written using the recent ES2015 syntax, avoiding awkwardnesses from the past.
* **Practice-oriented**. No learning comes without doing! Each chapter is accompanied by a series of exercises to put your newly acquired skills into action. A three-part project will guide you in the creation of a complete social news web application.
* **Easy to follow**. Code along directly in your browser or build yourself a great JavaScript development environment.
