## Markdown flavor

Leanpub uses a specific flavor of Markdown. As much as possible, this book is written using GitHub-Flavored Markdown to improve rendering on GitHub and elsewhere, while staying compatible with Leanpub.

The only exceptions are info, tip, warning and error text boxes defined with `I>`, `T>`, `W>` and `E>` instead of the classic `>` syntax. Read the [Leanpub documentation](https://leanpub.com/help/manual#leanpub-auto-more-text-block-types) for more details.
