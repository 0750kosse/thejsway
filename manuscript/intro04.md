# What you'll need

## TL;DR

* The easiest way to get your feet wet and try the code samples is to use a JavaScript playground like [CodePen](http://codepen.io).
* If you don't have access to a reliable Internet connection, an alternative is to set up a development machine with a code editor and a appropriate folder structure.
* In all cases, you'll need the most recent version of a modern web browser.

## Environment setup

Few things are more frustrating than starting to learn something new and then having to spend hours trying to set up a proper work environment. Fortunately, one of the beauties of JavaScript code is that it can run on almost any browser. We'll be using this to our advantage throughout this book. No complex setup requiring administrative rights on your machine: all you'll need is a modern browser and an active Internet connection (see below if you don't have access to a reliable connection or must work offline).

I> A **browser** is the software you use to visit webpages and use web applications. Check the site [whatbrowser.org](http://whatbrowser.org/) for more info and advice about upgrading your browser.

This book targets a recent version of the JavaScript language. Whatever browser you choose to use (or have access to), it's important that you upgrade it to its most recent version.

Once your browser is updated, the quickest and easiest way to follow along is to use an online JavaScript playground. My personal favorite is [CodePen](http://codepen.io), but there are alternatives like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/).

I> A **JavaScript playground** is an online service where you can type some JavaScript code and immediatly visualize its result without any environment setup.

## CodePen 101

If you choose to use CodePen along with this book, you *really* should start by visiting [Welcome to CodePen](https://codepen.io/hello/). It introduces the platform in a very friendly way and gives you everything you need to get started.

In addition, there are some helpful articles in the CodePen documentation about [autocomplete](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/editor/autocomplete/), the [console](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/editor/console/), [pen autosaving](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/editor/autosave/), [keybindings](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/editor/key-bindings/) and [auto-updating](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/editor/auto-updating-previews/). Albeit not mandatory, mastering CodePen will make you more productive while studying this book.

T> I advise you to enable autosave and disable auto-update for all your book-related pens. Showing the CodePen console will often be needed to look at the results produced by the code.

You should use a pen (not necessarily saved) to try every code sample this book contains. You should also dedicate a specific and saved pen to each exercise you'll search.

## Working offline

Using CodePen or another JavaScript playground requires a reliable Internet connection. If that's not your case (or if you prefer/have to work offline), you'll need to use a code editor on your machine. Here are some of them:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (my personal favorite).
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).
* [Atom](https://atom.io/).
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

To learn how to test JavaScript code locally and set up your machine with an appropriate folder structure, follow [these instructions](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/learn-the-basics-of-javascript/configure-your-work-environment#/id/r-3677157).
