# Book overview

## TL;DR

* This book is divided into three main parts to be read in sequential order: the first teaching the language basics, the second about using JavaScript in web pages and the third dealing with more advanced topics.
* Each chapter is associated with a series of exercises. Searching them seriously is very important.
* The easiest way to try the code samples and search the exercises is to use a JavaScript playground like [CodePen](http://codepen.io).
* If you don't have access to a reliable Internet connection, an alternative is to set up a development machine with a code editor and a appropriate folder structure.
* In all cases, you'll need the most recent version of a modern web browser.

## Structure and organization

This book is divided into three main parts. The first one teaches the basics of programming with JavaScript. The second one explains how to use JavaScript to create interactive web pages. The third one deals with more advanced concepts of the language. Each part depends on the previous ones, but there's no other prerequisite to reading.

Each chapter is associated with a series of exercises in which you'll have to apply the chapter concepts. These exercises are as simple and to the point as possible. Searching them is **absolutely essential**: real learning comes with practicing, not just reading.

## What you'll need

Few things are more frustrating than starting to learn something new and then having to spend hours trying to set up a proper work environment. Fortunately, one of the beauties of JavaScript code is that it can run on almost any browser. We'll be using this to our advantage throughout this book. No complex setup requiring administrative rights on your machine: all you'll need is a modern browser and an active Internet connection (see below if you don't have access to a reliable connection or must work offline).

I> A **browser** is the software you use to visit webpages and use web applications. Check the site [whatbrowser.org](http://whatbrowser.org/) for more info and advice about upgrading your browser.

This book targets a recent version of the JavaScript language. Whatever browser you choose to use (or have access to), it's important that you upgrade it to its most recent version.

Once your browser is updated, the quickest and easiest way to follow along is to use an online JavaScript playground. My personal favourite is [CodePen](http://codepen.io), but there are alternatives like [JSFiddle](https://jsfiddle.net/) and [JS Bin](http://jsbin.com/).

### CodePen 101

If you choose to use CodePen along with this book, you *really* should start by visiting [Welcome to CodePen](https://codepen.io/hello/). It introduces the platform in a very friendly way and gives you everything you need to get started.

In addition, there are some helpful articles in the CodePen documentation about [autocomplete](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/editor/autocomplete/), the [console](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/editor/console/), [pen autosaving](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/editor/autosave/), [keybindings](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/editor/key-bindings/) and [auto-updating](https://blog.codepen.io/documentation/editor/auto-updating-previews/). Albeit not mandatory, mastering CodePen will make you more productive while studying this book.

T> I advise you to enable autosave and disable auto-update for all your book-related pens. Showing the CodePen console will often be needed to look at the results produced by the code.

You should use a pen (not necessarily saved) to try every code sample this book contains. You should also dedicate a specific and saved pen to each exercise you'll search.

### Working offline

Using CodePen or another JavaScript playground requires a reliable Internet connection. If that's not your case (or if you prefer/have to work offline), you'll need to use a code editor on your machine. Here are some of them:

* [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/) (my personal favourite).
* [Brackets](http://brackets.io/).
* [Atom](https://atom.io/).
* [Sublime Text](https://www.sublimetext.com/).

To learn how to test JavaScript code locally and set up your machine with an appropriate folder structure, follow [these instructions](https://openclassrooms.com/courses/learn-the-basics-of-javascript/configure-your-work-environment#/id/r-3677157).
