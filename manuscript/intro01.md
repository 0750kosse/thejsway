# Who this book is for

First thing first: thanks for having chosen this book. I hope reading it will be both beneficial and pleasurable to you.

This book is primarily designed for beginners. Having taught programming basics to hundreds of students, I tried to write it in the most friendly and accessible way possible. My goal was that no matter their background, everyone interested by programming should be able to follow along without too much difficulty.

However, this book can also be useful to people having some experience in software development. The JavaScript language is kind of a strange beast. It shares some similarities with other well-known programming languages such as Java or C#, starting with its syntax. On the other hand, JavaScript has *a lot* of unique characteristics that are worth learning. This book covers the majority of them. As such, it will be of interest to those wanting to get serious with JavaScript or needing their skills refreshed with the latest language evolutions. Each chapter starts with a **TL;DR** paragraph which summarizes it, so you'll be able to skip ahead if you already know a chapter's content.

Complete beginner or already experienced in programming, I wish you a great journey in the wonderful world of JavaScript!
