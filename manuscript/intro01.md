# About this book

First thing first: thanks for having chosen this book. I hope reading it will be both beneficial and pleasurable to you.

This book is divided into three main parts. The first one teaches the basics of programming with JavaScript. The second one explains how to use JavaScript to create interactive web pages. The third one deals with more advanced concepts of the language. Each part depends on the previous ones, but there's no other prerequisite to reading.

Each chapter starts with a **TL;DR** paragraph which summarizes it. It's possible to skip ahead when a chapter's content is already known.

Welcome to the wonderful world of JavaScript!
