# About this book

First thing first: thanks for having chosen this book. I hope its reading will be both beneficial and pleasurable to you.  

This book is divided into three main parts. The first one teaches the basics of programming with JavaScript. The second one explains how to use JavaScript to create interactive web pages. The third one deals with more advanced concepts of the language.
Each part depends on the previous ones, but there's no other prerequisite to reading.

Each chapter starts with a **TL;DR** paragraph which summarizes it. It's possible to skip ahead when chapter content is already known.

At the end of each chapter, you'll find a series of exercises where you'll have to apply the chapter concepts. Searching these exercises is absolutely essential: real learning comes with praticing, not just reading.
Solutions of all exercises are online on the [CodePen]() platform.

Welcome to the wonderful world of JavaScript!
