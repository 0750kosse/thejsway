# The road ahead

You made it to the end of this book. Congratulations!

## TL;DR

This book covered a lot of ground. Here are some key takeaways.

* JavaScript is a **programming language** created in 1995 for adding interactivity to web pages. Still the language of the web, it has also parvaded many other environments: servers, mobile devices, connected objects, etc.

* JavaScript has been standardized under the name **ECMAScript** and is continuously improved. Its latest major version is **ES2015**, also known as ES6.

* JavaScript is **dynamically typed**: the type of a variable is deduced from the value stored in it.

* JavaScript is a **multi-paradigm** language: you can write programs using an imperative, object-oriented or functional programming style.

* JavaScript's object-oriented model is based on **prototypes**.

* When run into a browser, JavaScript can use the **DOM** (*Document Object Model*) to access and update dynamically the structure of a web page.

* JavaScript can send **AJAX** calls (asynchronous HTTP requests) to exchange data with web servers or use web APIs, enabling the creation of **web applications**.

* The **Node.js** platform, created in 2009 and built on Chrome's V8 engine, brought JavaScript outside the browser.

* Node emphasizes modularity. Its **npm** package registry is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

## What's next?

I hope these first steps into the JavaScript world inspired you to go further. If so, you are only at the beginning of a long and exciting journey!

> If you feel overwhelmed for now, take heart: grasping the concepts of programming takes time and practice. Don't get discouraged and be sure to follow the guidelines provided in the next few paragraphs.

### Keep on practicing

This is by far the most important advice. Nothing will sharpen your skills and make you more confident as a JavaScript developer than practicing your craft on a regular basis.

In particular, I urge you to start building a **personal project** right now. This is the best solution to stay focused, create something meaningful and have fun along the way.

You may already have a project idea in the back of your mind. If not, here are a few things you could build:

* An interactive quiz application.
* A client for your favorite social network.
* A contact or TODO list manager.
* A simple game, like the famous [Connect 4](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Connect_Four).

Still undecided or looking for more? Take Wes Bos' free [JavaScript30](https://javascript30.com/) coding challenge and build 30 things in 30 days. Yes you can!

### Get a deeper understanding of the language

You hopefully learnt a lot already, but JavaScript is a surprinsgly deep language that still has a lot in store for you. The most prominent free resources to strengthen your knowledge are:

* Kyle Simpson's [You Don't Know JS](https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS), a book series diving deep into the core mechanisms of the language.
* Marijn Haverbeke's [Eloquent JavaScript](http://eloquentjavascript.net) book, which covers many additional topics.
* The JavaScript section of the [Mozilla Developer Network](https://developer.mozilla.org/fr/docs/Web/JavaScript), full of reference material, guides and tutorials.
