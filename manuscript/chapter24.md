# The Node.js platform

In this chapter, you'll discover how to create JavaScript applications outside the browser.

## TL;DR

## Introducing Node.js

### A bit of history

To understand what is Node.js (or Node for short), we have to go back in time to the 2000's. As JavaScript was becoming increasingly important for improving the user experience on the web, web browser designers spent a considerable amount of resources on executing JS code as fast as possible. In particular, the Chrome JavaScript engine, codenamed V8, became open source in 2008 and was a huge step forward in general performance and optimization.

The core idea behind Node.js was simple yet visionary: since the V8 engine is so good at executing code, why not leverage its power to create efficient JavaScript applications *outside the browser*? And thus Node.js was born in 2009, originally written by Ryan Dahl. Its project quickly became very popular and Node is now one of the top technologies for building apps and creating APIs with JavaScript.

### A first example

> The rest of this chapter assumes a working Node environnement. Refer to the [appendix](#env-setup) for setting one up.

The simplest Node program possible is as follows.

```js
console.log("Hello from Node!");
```
